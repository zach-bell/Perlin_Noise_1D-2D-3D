# Perlin_Noise_1D-2D-3D
<p>This is my final project for data structures class at SIU.</p>
<p>Even though this type of project has vary little to do with data structures I still felt like making it for personal gain and exploration in what I could do.</p></br>
<p>This project shows an example of 3 different Java applications that express procedural generation using the Perlin Noise algorithm.</p>
<h2>1 Dimensional</h2>
<p>A representation of perlin noise expressed on a 2 dimensional graph plotted over time.</p>
<h2>2 Dimensional</h2>
<p>A representation of perlin noise expressed on a 2 dimensional plane where the expression of elements generated adjusts a grey scale value.</p>
<h2>3 Dimensional</h2>
<p>A representation of perlin noise expressed in a 3 dimensional environment where the expression of elements generated extrude a grids Z value making it 3 dimensional, and then adjusting the values over time through the input values increasing or decreasing.</p>
